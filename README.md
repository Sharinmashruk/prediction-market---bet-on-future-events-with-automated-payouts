# üîÆ Prediction Market DApp

## Project Vision

To create a decentralized, transparent, and automated prediction market platform that empowers users to bet on future events with guaranteed payouts, fostering a community-driven ecosystem for forecasting and collective intelligence.

## Project Description

The Prediction Market DApp is a blockchain-based platform built on Ethereum that allows users to create markets for future events and place bets on their outcomes. The smart contract handles all betting logic, fund management, and automated payouts without requiring intermediaries. Users can create markets on any future event, place YES/NO bets, and receive proportional payouts based on the total pool and their stake when markets resolve.

The platform operates on a simple yet powerful mechanism: users contribute to either the YES or NO side of a prediction, and when the market resolves, winners receive payouts proportional to their contribution and the total pool size. This creates natural price discovery and incentivizes accurate predictions.
